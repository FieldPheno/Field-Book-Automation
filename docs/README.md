# Field Book

## Introduction

Field Book is an open-source Android app that can be used to collect data on field research plots. When used in place of paper field books, it eliminates the need for data transcription and reduces the risk of errors. It runs on a wide range of inexpensive hardware, allowing consumer-grade technology to be used in environments where cost and inflexibility have been limiting factors. The source code for Field Book is available on GitHub.
