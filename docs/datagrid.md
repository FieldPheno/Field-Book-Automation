Datagrid
========

Overview
--------

DataGrid is accessed by pressing the
![grid](/_static/icons/settings/general/grid.png){width="20px"} icon in
the toolbar. DataGrid displays a matrix of entries and traits in the
active field. This view allows rapid identification of missing values.
Pressing an individual cell moves the collect screen directly to the
corresponding entry and trait.
