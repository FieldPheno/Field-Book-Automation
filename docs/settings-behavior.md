### ![repeat](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/repeat.png){width="20px"} Cycling traits advances entry

When enabled, once all active traits have been cycled, the app
automatically advances to the next entry.

### ![volume](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/contrast-box.png){width="20px"} Map volume keys to entry navigation

Allows volume keys to be used to move to next/previous entry. Note that
this disables the volume buttons being able to change the device volume
when Collect is open.

### ![return](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/keyboard-return.png){width="20px"} Return key signal

Allows the user to choose the behavior of the return key signal that can
be included when scanning barcodes: next plot, next trait, or do
nothing.

### ![arrow](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/unfold-more-vertical.png){width="20px"} Disable left/right entry arrow

Disables the left, right, or both entry arrows unless data has been
collected to ensure an entry isn\'t skipped during data collection.

### ![sharing](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/sync-off.png){width="20px"} Disable file sharing

Turns off the share dialog that opens by default when data is exported.

### ![day](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/calendar-today.png){width="20px"} Use day of year

Changes the date trait format to record date values as numbers counting
up from Jan 1, rather than traditional dates. For example _96_ instead
of _2023-04-06_.

### ![skip](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/eye-off.png){width="20px"} Skip entries across active trait

When advancing entries, skips either entries that already have data for
the active trait, or entries that already have data for all traits.

### ![flip](/_static/icons/settings/behavior/gesture-tap.png){width="20px"} Flip Flop Arrows

Switches the collect screen arrows so that the small green arrows
advance entries and the large black arrows advance traits.
