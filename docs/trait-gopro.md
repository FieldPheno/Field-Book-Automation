===========================================================================

Overview
--------

The GoPro trait format is used to capture images with an external,
Bluetooth-connected GoPro camera. It is created with a trait name and
optional details.

On the collect screen, once a GoPro is connected via Bluetooth, it can
be opened using the
![connect](/_static/icons/formats/connection.png){width="20px"} button.
Once connected, press the
![gopro](/_static/icons/formats/camera-gopro.png){width="20px"} icon to
access it and capture images. Multiple photos can be captured for each
entry.

Photo files are named with the entry\'s unique identifier, the trait
name, the photo number, and a timestamp. They are stored as .jpg files
in a field-specific subdirectory
(`plot_data/FIELD_NAME/gopro/PHOTO_FILE_NAME.jpg`).
