Barcodes
========

To improve data entry, Field Book includes built-in barcode scanning
features that use the device camera to collect data or move to a
specific entry.

Most Android devices are also compatible with external barcode scanners
that connect via USB or Bluetooth and act as a hardware keyboard. They
can be used to directly capture data from barcodes into any input field
that uses the device keyboard, including many traits.

Examples
--------

### Plant height

Barcoded height sticks can be used to rapidly capture plot height
values. Attaching the Android device to the stick makes it possible to
accurately capture height without having to hold both the height stick
and the device.
