----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Turns on repeated measures. When turned on, a green plus symbol appears
next to the trait value entry box on the collect screen.

When pressed it creates a new entry field for collecting an additional
observation on the same plot for the same trait.

To export data that includes repeated measures make sure to chose the
_*Database*_ format or to use BrAPI. These formats allow repeated
measures to be differentiated by timestamp. If exporting in _*Table*_
format then only the latest measurement will be included.
