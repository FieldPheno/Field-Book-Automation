=====================================================================

Overview
--------

The photo trait format is used to capture images. It is created with a
trait name and optional details.

On the collect page, the camera icon opens the device camera to capture
images. Multiple photos can be captured for each entry. Photo files are
named with the entry\'s _*unique\_id*_, the trait name, the photo
number, and a timestamp. They are stored as .jpg files in a
field-specific subdirectory
(`plot_data/FIELD_NAME/picture/PHOTO_FILE_NAME.jpg`).
