Training Resources
==================

In addition to this documentation, we have created training materials
that can be used to introduce Field Book to breeders and technicians.
These materials are also useful for bringing existing users up-to-speed
with new features. This [training
presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Milb9mO_LNtLmgo4AQYH7nQ-9E428gGv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109819954855460677835&rtpof=true&sd=true)
introduces Field Book\'s core features and key settings with
accompanying excercises.

The exercises in the the training slides are based on the
[training\_sample.csv]{.title-ref} field file which is copied into the
field\_import directory on install and is imported as part training.
