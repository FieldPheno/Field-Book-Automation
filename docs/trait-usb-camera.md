![camera](/_static/icons/formats/webcam.png){width="20px"} USB Camera Trait
===========================================================================

Overview
--------

The USB camera trait format is used to capture images with an external
camera. It is created with a trait name and optional details.

On the collect screen, once a camera is connected via USB, it can be
opened using
![connect](/_static/icons/formats/connection.png){width="20px"}. Once
connected, press the
![camera](/_static/icons/formats/webcam.png){width="20px"} icon to
access it and capture images. Multiple photos can be captured for each
entry.

Photo files are named with the entry\'s unique identifier, the trait
name, the photo number, and a timestamp. They are stored as .jpg files
in a field-specific subdirectory
(`plot_data/FIELD_NAME/usb-camera/PHOTO_FILE_NAME.jpg`).
