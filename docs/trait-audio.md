![audio](/_static/icons/formats/microphone.png){width="20px"} Audio Trait
=========================================================================

Overview
--------

The audio trait format is used to record audio. It is created with a
trait name and optional details.

On the collect page, press the
![audio](/_static/icons/formats/microphone.png){width="20px"} button to
begin recording audio. Press the
![stop](/_static/icons/formats/stop.png){width="20px"} button to stop
recording. Press the
![play](/_static/icons/formats/play.png){width="20px"} button to play
back the audio that has been recorded.

Recorded audio files are named with the entry\'s unique\_id and a
timestamp. They are stored as `.mp3` files in a field-specific
subdirectory (`plot_data/FIELD_NAME/audio/AUDIO_FILE_NAME.mp3`).
